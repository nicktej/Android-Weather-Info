# Weather Info

This is a weather application! It uses the weather API, along with views and databases to store the weather information. All you have to do is key in the city of choice and you get the weather and all relevant information!

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, and an emulator or an Android device.

### Installing

The only thing to note after downloading this is that some parts might be outdated, and the program was built with a specific package. You should probably change the manifest file.
